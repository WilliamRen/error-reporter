This project presents a simple and effective way see that uncaught exceptions
that occurr during your application's use are reported back to you.

The only files you need to concern yourself with are:

 - /src/com/guzba/errorreporter/ErrorReportingService.java
   (necessary implementation)

 - /src/com/guzba/errorreporter/UncaughtExceptionReporter.java
   (necessary implementation)

 - /src/com/guzba/errorreporter/DemoActivity.java
   (some necessary wiring and examples)


And you will need to add the following lines to your Android Manifest:

<service android:name=".ErrorReportingService">
     <intent-filter>
         <action android:name="com.guzba.errorreporter.intent.ERROR" />
     </intent-filter>
</service>

and

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
